### The journey we'll build

**Story:** In the fictional city of Owl Harbour, Alex decides to visit Signal City Market from TwiliTown. The city's integrated multi-modal mass transit system, TwiliTransit, plans and guides Alex through the journey as Alex goes from a Bus to a Ferry to a Metro, with rich, contextual messaging at each step.

<details>
<summary><strong>Scene details</strong></summary>

1. **Trip planning:** Alex texts "Plan my trip to Signal City Market" to the TwiliTransit number, and receives a journey plan. The journey begins with a walk to the TwiliTown Main St. Bus stop to board a bus to the Ferry. Alex also receives with an option for a reminder before the bus arrives.
2. **Bus boarding:** Alex's bus boarding reminder time arrives. Alex receives a reminder text asking to confirm if Alex has reached the bus stop. Then, Alex receives the details of the bay where the bus will arrive.
3. **Ferry transfer:** As Alex's bus journey is about to end, and Alex nears the Ferry terminal, Alex receives a boarding pass QR code for the Ferry, and directions from the bus to the Ferry docks.
4. **Metro transfer** - As the Ferry journey is about to end, Alex receives a message with Metro arrival/depature timing, platform and route map, along with an option to book rideshare once the metro ride ends.
5. **Journey completion:** As the Metro ride ends, Alex receives a trip summary with receipts.

## Build

Let's start with the Build session for the workshop.

### 1. Set up RCS Sender and Messaging Service

> [!NOTE]
> This section runs through the [RCS Onboarding guide](https://www.twilio.com/docs/rcs/onboarding). If you already have an RCS Sender, a Messaging Service, and have assigned the RCS Sender to the Messaging Service, you may skip to the next section.

#### 1.1. Create RCS Sender

<details>
<summary>View detailed steps to create an RCS Sender</summary>

- Go to Twilio Console -> RCS -> [Senders](https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/rcs/senders). Click "Create New Sender".
- Enter Sender Display Name: "TwiliTransit". Continue.
- On the next page:

    - Terms of Service: [Copy this URL](https://forge-assets-5378.twil.io/twilitransit/tos.md) (_Right click and copy link_), or download and host [`assets/tos.md`](assets/tos.md)

</details>

<details>
<summary>See RCS Sender preview till this point</summary>
You should see a preview that looks like this:

![RCS Sender Preview](assets/rcs-sender-preview.png)

</details>

> [!CAUTION]
> **DO NOT submit the Sender for Carrier Approval.**

#### 1.2. Add device to test the RCS sender

After the Sender is added, go to the Sender settings -> Test -> "Add device to test this sender". If you have a phone with RCS enabled, add the number here.

You will receive an RCS message asking you to confirm that you want to be a tester. Accept that and we are good to go.

#### 1.3. Assign RCS Sender to Messaging Service

Create a Messaging service and assign RCS and SMS senders.

<details>
<summary>View detailed steps</summary>

- Go to Twilio Console -> Messaging -> [Services](https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/sms/services). Click "Create Messaging Service"
- Step 1: Create Messaging Service
    - Messaging service friendly name: `TwiliTransit Service`
    - Select what you want to use Messaging for: `Notify my users`
    - Next
- Step 2: Add Senders. Add two senders. One for SMS and another for RCS.
    - Sender Type: `Phone Number` -> Continue. Select Phone Number -> Add Phone Numbers.
    - Sender Type: `RCS Sender` -> Continue. Select the TwiliTransit RCS Sender. Add RCS Senders.
- Step 3: Set up integration
    - _Leave with default choice for now_
- Step 4: Add compliance info
    - Complete Messaging Service Setup

</details>

You should now have a Messaging service that supports a RCS sender with SMS fallback, ready to go!

#### 1.4. Your first RCS message

🎉 Now that you have your first sender and messaging service in place, let's use it to send an RCS message directly through the Twilio API.

RCS Messages are sent using the [`Messages` resource](https://www.twilio.com/docs/messaging/api/message-resource) of the Twilio REST API, the same resource you use for SMS.

> [!NOTE]
> Use the requests in the "Prequel" folder of the [Postman collection](./Twilio%20Forge-%20Messaging%20Reimagined.postman_collection.json).
> Make sure to update the Postman environment's current value fields.
> Use your test device phone number as the `To` field value.

- Trigger a request using the `Messages` resource of the Twilio REST API. 
    - In the Postman collection, trigger "Prequel" -> "Your First RCS Message"
    - If the phone number in `To` field does not support RCS, it will get a SMS.

> [!TIP]
> You can also pass a [`MediaUrl` field](https://www.twilio.com/docs/messaging/api/message-resource#path-parameters) instead of `Body`.
> This field can take an array of a publicly available URI of a jpeg, jpg, gif or png.

- Trigger another request to demonstrate disabling fallback to SMS even when fallback is enabled in the Messaging Service.
    - In the Postman collection, trigger "Prequel" -> "Your First RCS Message - without fallback"
    - Note the use of `rcs:` prefix in the `To` field.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **DEMO:** Show the messages received on the given phone number.  
> Optionally, delete the messages to clean up the Sender.

If all went well, you would have received a RCS message on your test device.

### 2. Scene 1: Trip planning

Our TwiliTransit journey follows 5 distinct scenes from Alex's trip. Let's create content templates for the first scene.

**Go to Twilio Console -> Messaging -> [Content Template Builder](https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/sms/content-template-builder).**

In this scene, we want to send a welcome greeting as a [Text](https://www.twilio.com/docs/content/twilio-text), followed by the trip plan as a [Carousel](https://www.twilio.com/docs/content/carousel).

> [!NOTE]
> **Carousel (`twilio/carousel`) templates in RCS do not support the `Body` field.** Yet, the `Body` field is required because WhatsApp supports it.  
> 
> WhatsApp can send the `Body` field as a text before sending the cards of the Carousel.  
> RCS omits the `Body` field. So, for RCS, we have to first send the `Body` as a separate Text message.  
> We can leverage disabling fallback in this use case, and send the extra message only for RCS recipients.

#### 2.1. Create a Text template using Content Template Builder

In the Content Template Builder, click "Create your first content template" (or, "Create new" if you have existing templates). Create a "Text" template.

We will later send this template _without_ a fallback, so that it is only sent to RCS users. (See Note right above for the reason)

<details>
<summary>View detailed steps</summary>

- Template Name: `twilitransit_scene_1_1_initial_greeting`
- Template Language: `English`
- Content Type: `Text`
- Click "Create".

**Configure Content - Text:** In the "Text" tab:

**Body:**

```text
Hi {{name}}! Welcome to TwiliTransit! 🚎

Let's get you to {{dest}}.
```

</details>

> [!TIP]
> Variables are added within 2 curly braces. e.g. `{{1}}`.
> By default, the Content Template Builder uses numbers as variable names. e.g., `{{1}}`, `{{2}}` and so on.  
> While this quicker, it is a good idea to name your variables more descriptively. e.g., `{{name}}`, `{{dest}}`.  

> [!TIP]
> Now is a good time to quickly review all the [Content Types options](https://www.twilio.com/docs/content/content-types-overview) available. 

> [!NOTE]
> Content Templates cannot be edited after they are created.  
> You can always delete and recreate templates. Creating Content Templates through the API makes it more repeatable.  
> We will see that in action soon!

#### 2.2. Create a Carousel template using Content Template Builder

Next, create another Content Template that contains the Carousel. We will keep it simple for the workshop.

<details>
<summary>View detailed steps</summary>

- Template Name: `twilitransit_scene_1_2_trip_planning`
- Template Language: `English`
- Content Type: `Carousel`
- Click "Create"

**Configure Content - Carousel:** In the "Carousel" tab:

**Body:**

```text
Hi {{name}}! Welcome to TwiliTransit! 🚎

Let's get you to {{dest}}.
```

**Card 1:**

- Media URL: `https://forge-assets-5378.twil.io/twilitransit/{{start_image}}`
- Card Title: `Board a bus`
- Card Body: `Your trip starts from {{start_loc}}.`
- Button:
    - Type of Action: `Quick Reply`
    - Button text: `Remind me`
    - ID: `btn_1_2_reminder_bus`

**Card 2:**

- Media URL: `https://forge-assets-5378.twil.io/twilitransit/{{end_image}}`
- Card Title: `Trip end`
- Card Body: `Your trip ends at {{end_loc}}.`
- Button:
    - Type of Action: `Quick Reply`
    - Button text: `Email journey plan`
    - ID: `btn_1_2_email_journey`

**Dynamic Fallback:** Click Edit dynamic fallback. Select "Text". Continue.

**Text Fallback:** Switch to "Text" tab.

Body:

```text
Hi {{name}}! Welcome to TwiliTransit! 🚎

Let's get you to {{dest}}.

Your trip starts from {{start_loc}} and ends at {{end_loc}}.

Reply with REMIND to get a reminder 5 mins before your bus arrives.

Reply with EMAIL to get the journey plan emailed to you instead.
```

</details>

#### 2.3. Send Scene 1 messages using Twilio Messaging API


<details>
<summary>View detailed steps</summary>
